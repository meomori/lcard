This is a personal project written in Ruby on Rails, using HTML5/CSS3 and JavaScript.

The LCard attempts to make exchanging contacts easier but still have the joy of personalizing and collecting business cards.

The LCard allows you to store contact information of people you meet in both social and professional settings.

The project was started as a personal project for a coding bootcamp but is now a project that I want to improve on.
